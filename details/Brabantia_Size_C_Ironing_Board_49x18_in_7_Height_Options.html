			var commentsList = [{"user":"dandelionlove","content":"I owned a Brabentia wide ironing board 20 years ago, loved using it (as weird as that sounds), and then \u201clost\u201d it during a divorce... and I\u2019ve longed for one ever since. These are so much nicer than any other ironing board out there. My new ironing board arrived today, and it\u2019s just as sturdy and as well made as the one I used to have, which is so nice, since many companies seem to be downgrading their build quality these days.My ironing board was MADE IN LATVIA (not made in China, like nearly all the cheaply built ones you find from the discount/big box stores). And it\u2019s incredibly sturdy. It doesn\u2019t wobble or shift as you use it. The rack underneath the board is removable, but I\u2018ll keep it attached since it\u2019s very handy to use for items waiting to be ironed/folded items that have been ironed, for holding a basket of hangers, for holding tailor\u2019s hams or wool pressing mats, or if you have a steam generator for an iron, as long as the generator weighs less than 5 pounds or so. The rack is quite sturdy, and the iron rest is also sturdy and stable, with an adjustable arm to help secure your iron.The ironing surface is wider and a bit shorter than ones found on standard boards, so it\u2019s easier and faster to iron linens and fabrics for quilting and sewing. But it\u2019s not too wide for ironing clothing, and the small amount of board length lost poses no issues, really. This is a perfect proportion, in my opinion. If you\u2019ve only had a narrow \u201cstandard\u201d ironing board before, it might take some getting used to, but after using one of these a couple times, I doubt you\u2019ll ever want to go back to a narrow one! There\u2019s really no reason to want to.I also like that the board adjusts to a taller height than my old one, which is easier on my arthritic neck and back, but it can also be adjusted lower, to be used from a seated position (I\u2019m disabled, so this was important to me to have the option). And it doesn\u2019t squeak at all (some are like nails on a chalkboard!) when you open or close it. This is so much more stable than a more narrow board with the same style legs, and 1,000 times more stable than all of those T-leg boards out there! I plan to keep mine set up most of the time, but will mount a wall holder for those times when I need to put it away.The ironing board comes with a 10-year warranty and registration instructions (so save the printed card and large card stock insert with product info, since your barcode for registration is there).I do not work for this company or for Amazon (or for any company, since I\u2019m disabled and unable to work, lol)and I am not being paid or provided with any other consideration in exchange for this review. I\u2019m writing this because I find reviews to be helpful to me when making decisions, and I would like to help others, as well. I tend to overthink things, and am a bit of a perfectionist, so I tend to look for what is \u201cwrong\u201d with things, and if anything wasn\u2019t perfect about this, I\u2019d mention it (I\u2019m whiney like that lol). So if this review has been helpful, please let me know by clicking the button below. I\u2019ll update my review if anything changes, but I doubt I\u2019ll ever have to. This ironing board functions, looks and feels just like the one I used for many years, and that one never gave me any issues at all.","purchase_model":"Size: Size C (49 x 18&#034;) Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-06-05 15:43:13"},{"user":"Susan","content":"FIRST, THIS IS A REVIEW FOR BRABANTIA... background: I love to iron! I ordered 3 Bartnelli (I don't love to iron THAT MUCH) but each and every one was either unstable, dented, or damaged and defective in some way. VERY DISAPPOINTING AS ITALIAN PRODUCTS SUCH AS FABRICS AND LEATHER GOODS ARE KNOWN TO BE THE VERY BEST.BUT each ITALIAN BARTNELLI was returned and I ordered a BRABANTIA.It was supposedly delivered while I was at home, but I never got it. Amazon immediately ordered another.I have used it for a few hours: HERE'S THE SCOOP. It was perfect; no dents, damages etc.It is stable and wide.There is an ample iron rest, but it is metal (boo). The release lever works, there are several height adjustments and the BEST part is the legs have locking clip that very securely locks the legs in place for storage. Minor things noticed: 1. the metal rest is metal unlike the Bartnelli;I have easily found a solution as I bought a silicon pad for it and 2. the tip end could be a bit longer as I iron our pillowcases.So despite these very MINOR items, THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE BARTNELLI.","purchase_model":"Size: Size C (49 x 18&#034;) Color: Metalized  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-12 15:43:13"},{"user":"Josh","content":"I had purchased this for my wife as an upgrade from a cheap second hand one we had for years.

While this logic is usually applied to stand mixers and blenders, you should also apply it to ironing boards if you do a lot of home ironing or any type of fabric crafts.Paying over $100 for an ironing board may seem a little extravagant, this board is worth it.I'm 5'10\" and I do a lot of ironing, and I can iron everything from wide maxi skirts to pants without being hunched over the board or having my clothes drag on the floor while I iron narrow widths of fabric.Not only is comfortable and convenient to use to use, this board is built to last. Given that Brabantia is an established brand in the laundry and fabric care space and has a standard menu of board sizes, you can just buy a new cover when the current one wears out. As you can see from the picture posted with this review, mine has held up well after four years and a cross-country move.","purchase_model":"Size: Size D (53 x 18&#034;) Color: Titan Oval  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-14 15:43:13"},{"user":"DoctorDan","content":"I rarely write product reviews, but after two failed attempts (and hours of online research), we finally found the perfect ironing board\u2014and I had to share. Finding the right ironing board is surprisingly challenging! It needs to be sturdy yet lightweight, wide enough for efficient ironing but easy to store and retrieve. The Brabantia Size C Ironing Board checks every box. It hangs neatly on a wall-mounted hook, yet it\u2019s effortless for me or my wife to remove, adjust to the perfect height, and start ironing. Every detail is well-designed, from the smooth-operating height adjustment handle that locks securely in place to the rock-solid stability that eliminates wobbling. Best of all, it\u2019s ready to use straight out of the box\u2014no tools, no assembly, and no deciphering poorly written instructions. Brabantia nailed it\u2014this ironing board is a home run. If you\u2019re tired of searching for the perfect ironing board, this is the one.
