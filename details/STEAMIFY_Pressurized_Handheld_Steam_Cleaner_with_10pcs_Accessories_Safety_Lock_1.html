			var commentsList = [{"user":"Mario Palacios","content":"I recently purchased a pressurized steam cleaner, and I am absolutely thrilled with its performance. This device has truly revolutionized my cleaning routine. The high-pressure steam effectively cuts through grime, grease, and dirt on a variety of surfaces, from kitchen tiles to bathroom fixtures. It's incredibly satisfying to watch stubborn stains and buildup simply melt away with minimal effort.One of the standout features of this steam cleaner is its versatility. It comes with a range of attachments that make it suitable for cleaning everything from floors to upholstery. I particularly appreciate the precision nozzle, which is perfect for getting into tight corners and crevices that are otherwise hard to reach. The large water tank ensures extended cleaning sessions without the need for frequent refills, which is a huge time-saver.Another major plus is the fact that it uses only water to clean, making it an eco-friendly and chemical-free option. This is especially important to me as I have young children and pets, and I prefer to avoid harsh cleaning agents. Overall, the pressurized steam cleaner has exceeded my expectations in every way, providing a powerful, efficient, and environmentally friendly cleaning solution. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their cleaning arsenal!!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-02 15:43:15"},{"user":"Cheryl Buckley","content":"I love this steamer.I was skeptical if it would help with my cleaning.It worked very well.My first project was in the master shower-The wall grout lines with orangish color mold and nothing has seemed to work.I used my new steamer and the orange mold came right off.The floor grout was a dark dingy gray and I used my steamer with the little brush and it is now white in color.I was really impressed.My next move was my double vanity.I used the steam and hit the countertops and double sinks.Easy Peasy!Next was the big mirror above the sinksI used the steamer and a cloth and it was sparkling.I highly recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-20 15:43:15"},{"user":"Shivam P.","content":"First off, gotta give it credit for being very versatile. Somehow even when dealing with so much high pressure and steam, it is able to remain small and portable. And while it is small, it is very strong for the size it is. This was able to handle all my shower cleaning and deep cleaning needs and even worked on the kitchen floor which consists of beige squares with a black concrete/solid sand like lines in between them. After cleaning the entire kitchen and finally coming around on the floor tiles, all of us were shocked to find out that the black lines in between the squares were not actually black, but rather they were white concrete lines that had turned black over the years after years and years of use and foot traffic and dust and other debris. It was surprising to find that they were originally all white lines, and once we had gone through and cleaned every single one, it looked super clean, so its easy to see that this cleaner is actually effective while being small enough to move around easily without much work. If I had tried to clean the kitchen floor with a traditional cleaning solution and sponge/brush method, it would have taken forever compared to this. Overall, I am glad I bought this product and definitely recommend it to others.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-02 15:43:15"},{"user":"Purchaser","content":"Originally I left a one star review. I was using an extension that came with the steamer and this seemed to allow the steam to cool. It doesn't work continuously for 10 minutes as claimed -- mostly because it needs to reheat. I can live with that. Now that I forego using the extension, and have discovered what it is actually good for, I am very glad I bought this and think it deserves five stars.First, it makes certain chores very easy such as cleaning grime out of crevices, the top of baseboards and cleaning grime off the front of the stove. It is also good, with an attachment, for using as a steam mop on vinyl floor and cleaning windows. I simply wrap a towel around an attachment and rub it against the surface I'm cleaning.I've found that the same attachment is also wonderful for steaming clothes. I find myself using this every day for jeans, shirts and even undershirts. It is much faster than a regular clothing steamer and a lot easier than pulling out an ironing board and pressing clothes that will loosen up once worn anyway.I also use it to sanitize my dog bowls, dog toys, and the steam is enough to loosen up some nasty grime on metal spatulas used when BBQing.The downside is that it seems to only work in bursts before needing to reheat, but it doesn't take very long to do so. I clean small areas at a time instead of deep cleaning the house for a couple hours. There are also some surfaces that could be equally easy to clean with a sponge, but it is still rather convenient to walk around with a towel and the steamer to clean multiple surfaces with one setup and no chemicals.After doing lots of research, it seems a commercial unit would better fit my original expectations but those cost quite a bit more and for around $60 this unit is a deal.Overall, on surfaces I clean, it breaks up the grime and a towel wipes it up. This is a lot easier vs. scrubbing away at something with a harsh chemical.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-09 15:43:15"},{"user":"Kathy","content":"I was looking for a steam cleaner that was easy to work with. I am amazed when I use it at what a great job it does. Wonderful for the value of money. I would recommend it to anyone.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-02 15:43:15"},{"user":"JRangel42","content":"I initially bought this for bedbug prevention since these bugs can't take the heat. One of my neighbors in my building on the floor above me didn't report them. I found a couple of bugs, and I used the steamer to steam my carpet and small crevices I couldn't easily get with diatomaceous earth. It is all also safer than using poison, which is a concern for me since I have a dog. So far, I haven't seen any in the last couple of months.The steamer has helped me clean a few spots on my electric stove without having to rely on cleaning chemicals too much. The only drawback is the amount of water it can contain. Other than that, I can't really complain.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-28 15:43:15"},{"user":"Lawrence J.

This steamer does a fantastic job cleaning the grout with very little if any scrubbing needed. It works so well I even took it into work to clean the office fridge which was super gross. I had it clean with no scrubbing needed in 5 minutes. I didn\u2019t realize it can steam clothes too which is a cool bonus. I haven\u2019t tried that yet though. My friend said that she loves to use hers on the tracks for her sliding glass doors so that will be my next project.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-25 15:43:15"},{"user":"Brent W","content":"We had a mold issue in our car. This product, in tandem with a mold and mildew spray, was a terrific fix! Vacuuming after to remove residue and haven't had a recurrence. We also use to steam clean our spa during periodic drain and fill, and to steam wrinkles out of clothes on a regular basis. Unit is well built, strong, and produces plenty of steam per fill. A handy variety of tips and a flexible hose is great for hard to reach places. 5 stars and highly recommended!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-31 15:43:15"},{"user":"cyndi vogt","content":"I absolutely love my new steam cleaner!My daughter had it on her \u201cwish list\u201d for Christmas, but she had also put it on her list for her father-in-law to get her (not realizing it was on both list).Anyway she had Christmas with him first where she received her steamer.When I was at her house and saw it I told her that I had purchased her one also.Rather than send it back I decided to keep it for myself!I am so glad that I did\u2026\u2026I use it quite frequently!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-28 15:43:15"}];
