			var commentsList = [{"user":"lovetia06","content":"It's a space saver and convenient. It comes with 2 set of hooks for different size door. Before connecting it to the board,measure to see which hook fit your door first.If you don't have a little gap between in the door, it might be hard to close. I works fine. The hinges seem like it's strong because when you pull down it does have tension.It is a little bouncy but all as you iron and push down, it Will stabilize. As someone stated, put double sided table or command tape at the bottom to hold it in place because as you open it does bounce. Putting the double tape will keep it stable.I just got it so not sure how long it will hold up. But it works so far.","purchase_model":"Color: Silver Color: Silver  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-21 15:43:13"},{"user":"kren","content":"UPDATE, 8/8/18 (have had this board nearly 4 yrs now & want to update one small detail for anyone who might also have their board mounted on the inside of a door and has experienced the same problem.)Because I have the ironing board mounted on the INSIDE of a closet door rather than the outside of a door, the door has to be open while I iron and the ironing motion made the door constantly move and want to close.I'd been using a bungee cord hooked around the door knob and to a desk behind the open door to hold it open, but that was far from ideal solution....still movement in the door when ironing and kind of a hassle.I found a pack of three plastic door wedges at the Dollar Tree and that's been WAY better than the bungee cord!These are the small door wedges that you push under a door to wedge it tightly open.The three I got in my package are made of very light weight plastic and work very well on my carpeted floor.I wedge one under the door while ironing, absolutely NO movement of the door at all, and when I'm done, I pull the wedge out and stick it between the two bars on the back of the folded-up ironing board until next time. PERFECT!If it was possible to love this ironing board more than I already did, this simple, inexpensive solution made it so.UPDATE: 12/15/14 - I've had this ironing board (and the cover, sold separately) for over 2 months now, and I love it even more than I did initially! The problem w/ keeping the door open while ironing is solved for now...still one of those cute little bungie cords hooked to a desk behind the door when opened for ironing.The piece of cloth has been replaced by something \"pretty\", and that simple solution works, I'm happy with it & so is hubby...one less \"thing\". I was afraid the slightly smaller size would be a problem, but I got a separate iron holder that clamps to the side of the same desk so the iron doesn't take up room on the board, and it's just fine.I've even ironed a couple lge tablecloths and noticed very little difference from my big board when using the iron holder.While you could get by without the additional cover, I'm now glad I got it and would get it again.It just makes a really nice ironing surface....and looks nice, too.I'm back here to order my 78 yr old mother this board and the cover (and probably some kind of iron holder) for Christmas.My parents are old-school, and she does alot more ironing than I do.Not having to fight with that awful, heavy, clunky ironing board will be a blessing for her, and I know she's going to love it!I'm changing my 4 star rating (from below) to a 5 star.It's so much better than the alternative, and lowers & raises so seamlessly that a couple small glitches are merely tiny dings in the 5th star.Original Review: I went looking for a \"hide-away\" ironing board w/ easy access & found several designs w/ a WIDE pricing range...from under $30 to over $800!I settled on this one based upon reviews & have found most of them to be accurate.I hung mine on the INSIDE of a closet door, and it's obviously designed for the outside/room side of a door.The iron holder is a joke no matter which side of the door you hang it on. (Who in the world is going to reach that far over your head to store an iron, not to mention the fear that it could FALL on your head!)If you install the board on the inside of the door, the door will not be able to close with the iron holder attached. Since it's useless to me, anyway, I just took it off & that issue was solved.Also, w/ it installed on the inside of the door, I must have the door open when I iron, and that presented a more difficult problem.The motion of ironing makes the door want to close.I rigged a temp solution until hubby can come up with something better.(I bungy cord the door knob to a small desk that sits behind the door when it's open & put a folded up cloth between the desk & the door to \"tighten it up\" so the door doesn't bounce against the desk when I'm ironing.While it solved the immediate problem, it makes a board that's otherwise SUPER quick & easy to lower for use not quite as quick and easy, but it works for now. (It's hard to explain but just be aware that you'll have to deal with a door that wants to close if you hang your board on the inside of the door & must have it open to iron.)Like others, I velcroed the bottom stabilizing feet to the door to prevent the board from jumping against the door during ironing.As far as the front of the board bouncing (because it doesn't have a front support leg), I haven't found that to be a problem so far.The hanging brackets do make my closet door close tightly, but it does close.However, I'm pretty sure that the brackets rubbing on the frame whenever the door is opened and closed will eventually cause wear marks or scuff marks on the top of the frame.Our house is new, and that thought doesn't please me, but it's not enough to make me go back to the inconvenience of a classic ironing board or to spend more money on another style of stow-away board that will probably not work any better and may have other issues of its own.Based upon the reviews saying the cover that comes on the board is too thin, I ordered the cover that's available separately for this board at the same time I ordered the board but wish I'd have saved the $10.00.I didn't find the included cover to be too thin and would've gotten along fine w/o the after-market cover.That being said, the 2nd cover is very nice and padded and also looks better than the one that comes on the board.(It's no picnic getting it on, though.)The board is all metal and seems like a quality, durable, product, and installation could NOT BE EASIER....it literally takes a few minutes!The hardest part of the whole process was finding a stool to stand on so I was tall enough to get the hanging brackets over the door.(And another thing that impressed me...there are two sets of hanging brackets included, one for \"residential doors\" and a wider set for wider \"commercial doors\".I'll never use the wider brackets but the fact that they included both to insure their product could be used on a thicker door really impressed me!)Overall, I'm satisfied with this ironing board, think it's well worth the very reasonable price and would buy it again.I'm deducting one star for the poorly designed iron holder and the fact that it does take some extra rigging to stabilize the bottom support \"feet\" to prevent the board from jumping against the door during ironing (which, by the way, doesn't affect its performance but is very annoying!)","purchase_model":"Color: Silver Color: Silver  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-10-01 15:43:13"},{"user":"Andrea Kronenberger","content":"I really like this ironing board. I put this is a short term rental to save space. It looks so cool. It works perfectly. I did put 2 zip ties around the bottom to secure the bottom of it to the door. This isn\u2019t necessary but since this is a STR, I had thought I better b/c it bounced on the door a little when opened and shut although there are rubber clear protectors on the ends of bracket. I like the look, the space saving and convenience of this so I will be buying another one!","purchase_model":"Color: Silver Color: Silver  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-20 15:43:13"},{"user":"Sharris","content":"Works as expected.

Only downside is side is the hook to hang the iron for storage is at the upper most end near the mounting hooks and a 5\u20191\u2019 I cannot reach it.
