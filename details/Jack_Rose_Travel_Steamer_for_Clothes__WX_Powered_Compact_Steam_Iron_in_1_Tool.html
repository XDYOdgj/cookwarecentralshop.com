Honestly this makes a great gift and I got a few for Christmas presents already. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t iron on vacation, this is such a perfect steamer. I\u2019ve used it at home too and have reached for this one over my larger steamer because it\u2019s easier to handle.Pros- sturdy, chic color and modern design, strong steam pressure, compact for travel. Really appreciate that it included the hot pad to set down on the counter while using. Verrrrry helpful.Cons- the water reservoir doesn\u2019t hold much but this isn\u2019t really a con because it\u2019s to be expected with such a small steamer.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-11 15:43:08"},{"user":"Mike Grubb","content":"The Jack & Rose Dual Voltage Travel Steamer for Clothes is a game-changer for frequent travelers and those constantly on the go.

I\u2019ve been looking for a steamer that doesn\u2019t leave water stains from water leakage all over your clothing as you steam and I have finally found one that works perfectly! It also gives Dyson vibes with the packaging/colors.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-06 15:43:08"},{"user":"Mr. Amit","content":"My fianc\u00e9e and I have been working really hard to travel as light as possible whenever we fly abroad to Europe, Asia from the US.. carry-ons only, as traveling heavy the way we used to with check-in luggage pretty much sucks and ends up taking time out of our plans as you ultimately have no choice but to wait around for your luggage to arrive in baggage claim. One of the items we cannot seem to do without is a garment steamer.. we have a proper steamer that we use at home, so as you can imagine it is invaluable to have one available while we're traveling. We purchased the Rowenta Xcel DR7051 travel steamer some time back.. and although it works great and also has the dual-voltage feature that we've so desperately needed, its design results in it taking up just a HUGE chunk of space in our carry-ons, so needless to say we've been keeping our eyes peeled for a travel steamer with a more space-friendly design in mind.Enter the Jack & Rose K1 steamer! Initially I wasn't a fan of the slate/pink color, but honestly who cares if the bloody thing works? This steamer not only performs VERY WELL in that arena, but it delivers on a number of fronts: it is lighter than the Rowenta, it has a much thinner profile which fits very well within our carry-ons, it can expand via rotation of the steamer head for larger surface areas, it runs incredibly efficiently on one full tank of water (we were able to thoroughly steam 4-5 garments without the need to refill), the cable is generously long at nearly 8ft in length, it can be used like an iron in both steam & steamless modes, and the best part is that it is dual-voltage (100-240V) and worked perfectly on our recent trip to both France & Italy (when used with a simple US-to-EU plug adapter of course, I'd suggest making sure to have such an adapter ready for the country in which you plan to travel beforehand!)This is precisely what we've been looking for, and frankly we couldn't be happier. As of writing this review (January 2024), the $55 deal via the clippable coupon is STILL available and is very hard to beat, so please jump on the opportunity to grab this deal if you are able! You will not be disappointed at all!","purchase_model":"Color: Purple Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-05 15:43:08"},{"user":"Erik in St. Louis","content":"I've only had this for a couple months so it's only been on a handful of trips but so far it's been great. Very powerful steam flow. Very portable taking little room in your bag.
