			var commentsList = [{"user":"Eric F","content":"recently got this travel Iron & Steamer and have been extremely impressed with its performance. As someone who travels frequently, I was looking for a compact and versatile device, and this is perfect.The 2-in-1 design allows it to function as both a traditional iron and a steamer, making it perfect for quick touch-ups or dealing with some wrinkles (especially after being packed in a suitcase).It heats up surprisingly fast, and the steam function is powerful enough to handle a variety of fabrics, from delicate silks to thicker cottons. The compact size means it doesn't take up much space in my luggage, and it's lightweight, so it doesn't add much to the overall weight of my suitcase.The cord length is ample. Some more compact items like this sometimes have a ridiculously short cord, however I have had no issues with this.The steamer heats up in less than a minute, and comes with a stand to set it on while it is hot. A mitt was also included to protect your hands from the heat/steam when steaming fabrics.The only downside is that its small water tank requires frequent refills if you're tackling multiple items at once, but that's a minor issue for a travel-sized iron. Overall, this travel Iron & Steamer is a great little gadget to have while on the go. It's performance, convenience and probability are great for at home, too, when you don't want to worry with your big iron/ ironing board.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-20 15:43:13"},{"user":"Harrison Jerome","content":"So, I will say that steamers of any kind have always disappointed me. I've spent anywhere from a few dollars for a used one to just north of a benjamin on a nice one, and I've always wanted them to be a magic wand that you can wave and dismiss wrinkles on anything that's on a hanger.This steamer isn't any different in that regard, but if you can get past that (and I can) it excels as a travel iron with a steam function. My jeans aren't the best-photographing garment to test this on (some of what looks like wrinkles are actually part of the denim wash), but trust me when I say the iron worked great getting them out. The value proposition is interesting -- when are you *really* going to need a travel iron? Most hotels in the US will have one, and if you're couch-surfing, anyone cool enough with you to let you stay in their home will doubtless be cool enough with you to lend you their iron. That said, I'm sure there's a use case for these; there are likely some less-austere military deployments, dorm living situations or hostel travel setups where this would be a great fit, or if the people you couch surf with are the kind to let the dryer take care of most of the wrinkles for them. Overall, I'm happy with this product.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-22 15:43:13"},{"user":"T","content":"I've been thinking about replacing my big iron with a good steamer for ages, especially since my carpal tunnel and arthritis has worsened. But I hesitated because it's one of those \"oldies but goodies\" types that last and work FOREVER! I've had it for more than 15 years and it still works perfectly. But now I can donate it, because I have this. I wasn't expecting this to be a good iron as well as steamer! I love that the handle folds over the unit, so it's even smaller (frankly, the 8' cord is bigger than the appliance!). It also came with a cute mitt, water cup, and insulated base.Most importantly, it WORKS GREAT! I first used it as a steamer on a shower curtain that I was too lazy to iron, but just hung up, shipping creases and all. As mentioned, my hands and wrists aren't great, but this unit, even full of water, was not too heavy to use for the approximately 10 minutes to get the curtain almost perfect. It heats up very fast and the steam comes out pretty powerfully (so it goes through water quickly). I then used it as an iron on the collar and cuffs of a cotton/poly blend shirt. Since there are no temperature settings, be careful when using this as an iron! But it worked very well, and was so much easier, especially around buttons.I really hope this lasts a long time.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-18 15:43:13"},{"user":"RWNYC","content":"So I have a thing for vacuums AND steamers. My fave steamer has a similar concept, except not as easy to work with. The size and flexibility this thing offers!WOW.It is compact, it folds, it has a matte finish (well I chose a matte black finish there are other choices.) But I love that you can make a crease with it!My former favorite has a presser bar on it but it does not come close to this one. It heated up in less than a minute, it was really steady with the steam, it was consistent, and I can see by the size that it will be so much easier for curtains and hanging items.Lighter weight too! Very excited to play with it more. Has a non stick plate, a rest spot like a spoon rest, and even a cute little mit in case so you don't burn yourself when steaming inside of a garment which I am notorious for. I cannot get over how fast it produced steam. Bigger is not always better.And this one is def a perfect exemple!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-24 15:43:13"},{"user":"motionmonk","content":"My wife is planning a trip overseas, and instead of relying on the hotels to have a working steam iron that isn't corroded, rusty or burnt, we looked for a small travel iron. We found this Quuejenl 1000W Portable Mini Clothes Travel Steamer Iron and decided to order it.It's small and lightweight, but heats up quickly. Adding distilled or purified water creates a lot of steam, which is great for getting rid of wrinkles in packed clothing.She appreciates that there is a silicone pad that it can sit on, so it's not on furniture or somewhere where it could drip. It comes with an oven mitt for when it's too hot, and a nice travel bag to store it in. It folds up to be very compact too.We tested it and so far it's easy to use and should work great!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-06 15:43:13"},{"user":"Marnia","content":"I've had so called \"travel\" steamer, and they are small, but this is the lightest one I've ever had.It's easy to forget how heavy water is, this has a small reservoir, but I actually appreciate this as I have found my arm being weighted with some of the slightly heavier steamers.This dripped a lotwhenI first turned it on, but that seems to be due to over filling, so watch for that.That said, it did an excellent job of smoothing out wrinkles.I was even able to get insidethe pleat on the front of the shirt in the picture due to the compact size.This folds up small enough to fit in my smaller purses, a bit bulky in the smaller ones, but still fits.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-07 15:43:13"},{"user":"Eric","content":"This travel steamer is so convenient and easy to throw in my travel bag for business trips or a quick weekend getaway. It's small and compact and comes with a great little storage bag.The iron itself heats up quickly and removes wrinkles easily with the powerful steam function. It is also great for freshening up clothes that have been sitting in a suitcase or that have been hanging in the closet for a while. It does spit a little water sometimes, mostly when I first turn it on and it is heating up, but this has never been a problem. I'd recommend it for anyone who travels frequently or just wants an easy to pack iron to stay wrinkle free.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-08 15:43:13"},{"user":"Darlene G","content":"This is a great little travel steam iron.This even comes with a mini \"pot holder glove\" so you don't steam burn yourself.It also comes with an iron rest for when you need to place it down.The reservoir is small but that is ok - this is for travel so having a small reservoir keeps the weight down for travel.I highly recommend this steam iron.It comes with instructions and is easy to use.The handle simply turn in and out and kind of just stays in place when using and turns back to folded easily for traveling.If you are on the fence - I say get it!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-23 15:43:13"},{"user":"Unfriendly.1","content":"The CUTEST iron and steamer combo I've ever come across.
