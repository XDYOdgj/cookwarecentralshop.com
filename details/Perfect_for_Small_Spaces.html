			var commentsList = [{"user":"KarlD","content":"Wall-Mounted Ironing Bliss: My Xabitat Ironing Board ReviewLet's be honest, ironing isn't exactly our favorite activity. But if you're going to do it, why not make it as painless (and space-saving!) as possible? That's where the Xabitat Wall Mounted Ironing Board comes in, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer!Skepticism to Satisfaction: I admit, I was a bit wary when I ordered this. A wall-mounted ironing board? Would it be sturdy enough? Would it fold away neatly? My doubts quickly vanished as soon as I installed it.Sturdy as a Rock: This board is built to last. The heavy-duty metal frame feels solid, and the ironing surface itself is smooth. No more wobbly boards threatening to send your iron flying!Customizable Comfort: One of the things I love most about this board is the adjustable height. Whether you're a towering ironing giant or a vertically challenged warrior, you can find the perfect position to conquer those wrinkles. Simply install it on the wall based on a height comfortable to you.Space-Saving Savior: Let's face it, traditional ironing boards are space hogs. Not this beauty! When you're done ironing, simply fold the board flat against the wall. It practically disappears, freeing up precious floor space in your laundry room or bedroom.Minor Musings: My only suggestion for improvement? A slightly longer ironing surface would be ideal for those shirt sleeves and pants. But that's a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things.Overall Verdict: If you're looking for a sturdy, space-saving ironing solution that's easy to use and adjust, the Xabitat Wall Mounted Ironing Board is a winner. It's turned my chore into something almost enjoyable (okay, maybe not enjoyable, but less dreadful). Plus, the built-in iron holder keeps everything organized and within reach.Final Tip: Consider the available space in your laundry room or ironing area when choosing the size of the board. And trust me, your future self will thank you for investing in this wall-mounted wonder!","purchase_model":"Size: With Iron Holder Color: Blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-13 15:43:11"},{"user":"anonymous_","content":"The metal crush mounts were not suitable for drywall.

He had to use special screws for the drywall, but the product itself is sturdy. It is just big enough for my needs. It's not a large ironing board, so if you iron all of your sheets, I wouldn't suggest it. But for smaller jobs, it's perfect. It unfolds and folds up quite simply - no tricky parts. And, it does not need a \"leg\" underneath to stabilize it when it's down as the ironing board is sturdy enough to suspend by itself. I went back and forth on whether I wanted an ironing board in a cabinet so that the board is hidden, and I am glad I decided not to. My mother has the cabinet kind, and it is bulky, and if you don't put your ironing board away all the time, you also have an open cabinet too. This lies flat against the wall, it is small, and it is not obtrusive. I pretty much use it everyday, and I love how easy it is to use.Update: My ironing board is still up and in perfect condition. I have since bought two more as gifts. This is an inexpensive way to make life easier!","purchase_model":"Size: Without Iron Holder Color: Gray  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-05-25 15:43:11"},{"user":"Clokman","content":"This ironing board is secured at 4 points.

He had this to say:The sales videos and even reviews make this seem like an elegant assembly design, but it is not. There is much confusion concerning whether you can screw it right into your wall out of the box, so I will address this first.Four mounting molly bolts were confusingly provided in the kit (one pictured). However, due to the long shank, they are not suitable for standard 1/2\" or 5/8\" sheet rock. Many reviewing customers bought their own dry wall anchors, despite the instructions specifically saying not to mount on dry wall. Such anchors may be great for a TV or heavy piece of art, but since the ironing board is moving and bearing varying amounts of weight over the years, I chose to mount it onto the wall studs, per instructions. Since the studs in my laundry room are the standard 16\", I had to cut and mount two boards (not included) to the studs, and mount the ironing board (12\" wide) to these two boards, all with wood screw (not included).One pro reviewer suggested mounting two of four screws to a stud, and the other two to dry wall anchors as a compromise, but then you wouldn't have the freedom to place the ironing board where you want it.Regarding ironing board placement, I chose mount it flush against a French door frame. I had to flip some hardware (long shaft and retaining clip) to a mirror image from the OEM configuration so it would fit. The metal retaining clip was surprisingly brittle and broke when I tried to bend it, so I had to make a new one out of a coat hanger.The end product is sturdy, but not as pretty to look at with the stud-mounted boards behind it. I don't think anyone should be surprised at having to do this, but I'm giving it only 3 stars because of the misleading ease of assembly and appearance, and the broken retaining clip.","purchase_model":"Size: With Iron Holder Color: Gray + Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-30 15:43:11"},{"user":"Roger Reinardy","content":"Well built and easy to install, and on the inside of a closet door it is there when I need it.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-11 15:43:11"},{"user":"E & K","content":"A small laundry closet","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-10 15:43:11"},{"user":"Scott Rooks Headland, Alabama","content":"We recently moved into a new home and downsized to make the move. In the process we left our old ironing board behind and planned on buying new when we moved into our new home. But when I suggested this to my wife instead of a free standing ironing board, she was all in! We had a wall mount years ago and she loved it, so she was excited to get this. I mounted it in our laundry room and it folds up out of the way nicely. It is much easier to fold down and use than setting up a free standing style. Since the mounting holes are not 16\" dead center, and I did not want to trust hollow wall anchors, I mounted two 24\" boards horizontally, upper and lower, screwed them into the studs, then mounted the ironing board to the boards.
