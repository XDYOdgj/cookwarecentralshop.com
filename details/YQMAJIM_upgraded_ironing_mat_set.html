			var commentsList = [{"user":"Frogs & Flowers","content":"We are down sizing so I no longer want a gigantic ironing board to lug around & store.This pad is PERFECT. Great size to place on any flat surface to iron. Good padding & heat protection for surfaces too. No issues with heat pentrating through though steam is a different issue. It will not stop steam/ moisture from penatrating.White color is fine no issues or complaints. Though another color might have been nicer to look at.Easy to use, soft fabric, folds up easily to use later and rolls up easily too!Haven't gotten any stains on it so can't give a review with that info.So, so much nicer to use than an ironing board. One of the best inventions ever!","purchase_model":"Size: Small\uff0819 x 33 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-06 15:43:11"},{"user":"Anna G.","content":"tl;dr - this is a great quality, versatile, portable yet adequately-sized double- sided ironing mat + delightfully functional pressing cloth & silicone iron rest pad that could save your bundlehosen from death by iron-induced fire at some point.Please note that the two included \u201caccessories\u201d are well-designed ironing tools that would be worth purchasing on their own regardless, and probably for more than the cost of the ironing pad. It\u2019s a really good deal.The mat, as others have said, is double-sided. The additional benefit of this is that it is functional anyway you fold it, so one is able to completely customize the mat given one\u2019s work, space, and material - really, really helpful for traveling, not having to deal with an ironing board for true last minute finishing touches, for laying other hot things on (stones, flat irons, your terrible temper), etc.The pressing cloth (mesh protecting ironing cloth) is generally accepted as an ironing staple for any textile-addict while using sprays, or any other finishers where the fabric may be dampened- the mesh prevents flaking, scorching, clumping, and promotes an even finish, as well as to save one from an accidental shiny iron-shaped mark which is permanent and is indeed worse than wrinkle. Additionally, use it over seems, on reverse sides of labels, etc to prevent ironing-in the shape of the tag, etc deep into the fabric - something that is usually also permanent and can trash an otherwise nice garment. Others have correctly noted its use in crafting and quilting, and the benefits there do not to be belabored yet again.The silicone iron mat is not flimsy and may keep you from burning your house down or melting through something that doesn\u2019t want to be melted. Highly advise.P.S. Rest pad also serves as as oven mitt, pot-holder, spoon rest, hair straightener rest and/ or holder, pickle jar opener grippy thing, manual koozie, little animal massage for your pet\u2019s at-home spa days, triangle for your cat to sit on, coaster, icky trash bag grabber, also could possibly be used for a game of tiny horseshoe.","purchase_model":"Size: Small\uff0819 x 33 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-03-06 15:43:11"},{"user":"DEBB","content":"Works good. However, when steam ironing the steam goes through to the table top so be sure not to damage table top if using lots of steam. Otherwise, great product.","purchase_model":"Size: Extra large\uff0847 x 22 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-22 15:43:11"},{"user":"Grampa Joe","content":"Thisis a very functional, convenient two sided heat resistant ironing mat. It's slightly larger than most mats but that's a good thing. It's worth every penny you paid for it. Plus it comes with a fabulous, very convenient see through mesh ironing mat.(see pictures) We've never enjoyed two such functional ironing tools before plus they're mailing me a gift of my choosing free to boot. The mat is such a pleasure to use especially since we're ironing fusible interfacing and you can see exactly where you are under the ironing mat. We've never appreciated such a well designed product with user functionality at its best. Unfortunately we had some problems come up.5-19-19 Update: it's been a real pleasure to use, until we tried working with leather. One word of caution. Do not use the silicone mat onhigh. It works fine up to medium. We just set the iron on high to fuse some fusible interface and the moment we touched the silicone mat the iron put a hole in it.(see picture below) Other than that the mat. Iron stand, and the silicone ironing mat really are a pleasure to use. When using fusible interfaces, set your iron on medium and hold the iron in each fusing area spot for at least 15 seconds to completely fuse the interface to your material.Update: 7-3-18 A little disappointing experience today in that if you are applying fusible interfacing as we are on leather. The mat really is not thick enough to protect what you're ironing. Even if you iron on the smooth side of the mat, the diamond shaped design on the opposite side comes through and leaves a diamond shaped imprint on your leather. Undoubtedly , this is due to the mat being too thin to protect the imprint-able fabric you are fusing. We use our regular ironing board with no problem. So much for short cuts. Good thing we tested the mat first. It's a bit of an inconvenience and a disappointment.","purchase_model":"Size: Extra large\uff0847 x 22 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-05-10 15:43:11"},{"user":"Kat Ryker","content":"I received this ironing mat last week and am very very pleased with it, for more than one reason. First, I expected it, for the price, to be thinner. But it isn't.I could easily use this on a desk or table and while I would keep an eye on it, I suspect that it is thick enough to protect the surface quite well. It is reversible, with one side quilted and the other not. This comes in handy with light fabrics (using the plain side) and heavier fabrics (using the quilted side).I currently am using it on a counter in my laundry area and am quite happy with it.It comes with pressing pads, which are sometimes called scotch cloths. I use these on a couple of blouses I have that always need a touch up. And the best bonus of all was silicon iron rest.My iron doesn't like to sit on anything other than a hard flat surface, so I always have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't tip over if it is sitting on the ironing mat, or an ironing board.I ordered the 19 X 33 pad, which fits perfectly in my laundry room, but I may re-order and buy the slightly larger one and keep it on hand for larger jobs. Would highly recommend this product. Quality is very good, and it does exactly what it says it will do.Sorry for the wrinkles showing on the pad in the photo.I took the photo when I first unpacked it, not giving it time to flatten out.Now, its flat and used every day.","purchase_model":"Size: Small\uff0819 x 33 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2018-01-30 15:43:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"This ironing mat is a good size and very handy as I expected. One thing to consider though, which was a problem for me, just as described it is reversible, and allows steam to get deeply into your item for a very good pressing outcome. What that means though is that it is permeable and steam will go through to whatever surface you've laid it on to do your pressing. I used it on a table top and it got wet so I had to put another waterproof pad under it. May not be a problem for everyone but just know that your surface will get wet if you use it for steam pressing.","purchase_model":"Size: Small\uff0819 x 33 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-10 15:43:11"},{"user":"Cheryl","content":"Big enough to do the job.

I have never had such an outstanding customer service. I'm not going to go into detail here telling you how great they are because I don't think people should leave low star reviews in order to try to get stuff. That's not what I had done. Suffice it to say that they went over and aboveany expectations I had had. I had originally given this mattress pad 3.5 star review but based on their incredible follow-up service and their concern overissues I had with it which quite frankly were very small issues, makes me bump this all the way up to a five-star now. 3.5 for the product itself only because it wasn't exactly what I wanted. And another 1.5 stars for incredible follow-up and customer service!Remind me to say one more thing. If you're looking for a mattress pad that you can use to pack with you for travel purposes, or something you want can pull out and easily do a touch-up without having to wrestle an ironing board, this would be a perfect item for that. It is my bad that I wanted it for something like curtains. And of course it doesn't work for curtains. They're heavy and unwieldy.UPDATED REVIEW 10/28/19After leaving the following review, I was contacted personally by the seller. I found this very surprising and unusual.As you will see from my reviewI don't think this is a horrible product. Not was it defective in any way. I don't think it's meant to be replacement for a standard ironing board if you do a lot of ironing . But it's definitely worth tryingespecially for ironing smaller things.And when you add in the incredible customer service I receivedfollowing myuse of the item, I definitely had to bump it up to 4.5 stars. I can't give it a five-star , because I really WAS looking for an ironing board replacement. But it's perfect for people that want to roll it away and put it someplace else, use it for quick pressing, placing on your dryer for touch-up or pack it in a suitcase. It just didn't suit my particular needs.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I do not recommend using this on the waffle side. It will leave the marks on your fabric. The other side is not on anything firm, as it's meant to be able to be folded up and put away. Unfortunately this also means that it can get wrinkled and you have to pull out at to make sure that the piece of straight before you move your fabric around on it. Otherwise you're going to iron in a wrinkle from the ironing pad itself. I suppose for something that has to be folded and put away frequently and then put on a desk or table top for ironing, it's about the best that it could be.","purchase_model":"Size: Extra large\uff0847 x 22 inch\uff09   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-09-08 15:43:11"},{"user":"Jane Hale","content":"Life saver for ironing bedsheets For guests","purchase_model":"Size: Extra Extra Large(53*32inch)   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-12 15:43:11"}];
