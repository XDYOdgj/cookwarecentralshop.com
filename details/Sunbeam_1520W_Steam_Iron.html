			var commentsList = [{"user":"JS","content":"The main purpose for which I purchased this was to get wrinkles out of some blackout curtains that hadn\u2019t fallen out on their own for more than 6 months (I guess they never would have). This steamer did an excellent job on the lowest steam setting and probably could have done it even faster on a higher setting, but I didn\u2019t want to risk damaging the cloth. Before purchasing, I did a good amount of research, and while I\u2019m confident I could have done the job with something maybe half the price, I really wanted something that had the capability of handling everything from light to heavy duty - and wouldn\u2019t leak water all over my hardwood flooring in the process. This Sunbeam Professional Steamer is one of the more powerful handheld models I found, has 5 settings (including 1 dry mode, and 4 steam modes), Comes with 1 upholstery and 1 delicate fabric \u2018bonnet\u2019, an 8\u2019 cord (I used a heavy duty extension cord for anything beyond that reach), a non-leaking reservoir and pump system, and an excellent nonstick face that can be used vertically or horizontally. So far I have put this to use on 12 curtain panels, one skirt (my wife\u2019s), and one neck-tie, and it\u2019s done an amazing, quick and efficient job on each (and no leaks)!Now for some criticisms/gripes:1) It is a little heavy for extended use, but I expected that. This isn\u2019t so much a gripe or a criticism, I guess, but more of an observation for those with limited arm strength.2) while the bonnets are good and useful tools, the condensation that forms on them, does begin to drip fairly quickly. The machine itself isn\u2019t leaking, it\u2019s simply the condensation on the accessory bonnets. Once you remove them, the dripping will cease! If your application and environment won\u2019t be harmed, the bonnets are still excellent tools to use. I did want to note that this would be an issue for any brand of steamer that uses bonnets and is not a particular problem with this model. The bonnets are optional, so I simply took the delicate fabric bonnet off to protect my floors and continued on without further trouble.3) The design of the water reservoir could have been better in terms of removal from the machine. When you press the release button, the reservoir needs to be pulled forward to be released. However, there really isn\u2019t much on the reservoir to hold onto in order to get it off. What I am doing, is with the steamer off and facing me, I am pushing the release button and pulling on the reservoir\u2019s edge just under that release button. It does the job, but just seems more difficult than it should be. This is the one design flaw that I feel needs be addressed on the next iteration without question. For now,I have some rubberized grip tape that I may install, to create a couple gripping surfaces on the sides of the tank to aid in removal.4) When putting the reservoir back onto the machine, the tank needs to be aligned top and bottom and then pressed straight in. This is not a problem and isn\u2019t difficult. If, however, you don\u2019t press the tank inward with a positive, purposeful motion, you\u2019ll end up getting a little leakage in the process. I simply make sure to reinstall the tank over the counter or sink or anything else I don\u2019t mind getting a few drops of water on. No biggie! The machine goes right back to normal and doesn\u2019t leak in use.4) Probably my second biggest gripe next to the reservoir removal issue! I\u2019d really have liked Sunbeam to have included some type of reusable box like the one Electrolux provides with some of their models. The onlybox you get is standard cardboard and without re-inserting the cardboard shipping supports, the whole thing just kinda flops around inside. The Electrolux has a decent box designed for storage rather than the recycling bin - I wish Sunbeam had been as thoughtful. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but I see this (and the reservoir issue) as real areas of opportunity for an otherwise excellent product.Sunbeam has a real winner in the making and certainly an excellent product as is! Since this is only my 2nd day of ownership, my long term review will have to wait. I will post any pertinent updates as and if they arise, for now, I can honestly say, that knowing the several other sunbeam products I own and my experience thus far, I have no reservations in recommending this product to anyone looking for quality and versatility in a larger more powerful handheld steamer.","purchase_model":"Style:  Professional Style: Professional  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-02-22 15:43:13"},{"user":"Michelle Marie Holloway","content":"Excellent steamer.

I used to have a full size stand up steamer that I kept in the basement laundry room (where my ironing board and iron are) and it was taking just as much time to go down there, turn it on, wait for it to warm up, bring my garments down and steam them, as it would to just whip out the iron and iron them. Then I remembered the Evlis Duran crew raving about this after their Mexico trip so I found this and decided to purchase it.WHAT AN AMAZING PRODUCT!!! I keep this in my room with all of my clothes, so that way I can steam right away with my garmets as I take them out to wear them. It takes like 15 seconds to heat up and get ready so I can start steaming basically immediately! I just bought the basic unit \u2013 I don\u2019t think all the other accessories are necessary. How I steam my clothes \u2013 I have an over the door hook (1 hook) and then I hang a hanger on that hook, put my shirt on it, and steam it, turn the hanger around, then steam the other side. The steam does not get all over the door and it works like a charm.The basic unit comes with accessories like a lint cover, a protective cover (to prevent your hand from getting burned with steam) and an attachemnt to create a seam. It has a low and high setting so if you need to be more gentle with a garmet, use the low setting. I use the high setting on just about everything and so far so good.Would HIGHLY recommend this product \u2013 it makes getting ready in the morning SO EASY.","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Burst Style: Steam Burst  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-11-22 15:43:13"},{"user":"Andrea Jackson","content":"Works very well","purchase_model":"Style:  Power Steam Style: Power Steam  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-09 15:43:13"},{"user":"Margaret Blake","content":"Easy to use, gives a nice even steam over the fabric.","purchase_model":"Style:  Power Steam Style: Power Steam  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-11 15:43:13"},{"user":"EFC1","content":"I bought this item for steaming garments.

I've never had a clothes steamer before: this is my first one. Well, actually, I had bought one before this one that I didn't like. What I like about this one as opposed to the other one I'd bought and returned is that this one steams longer without needing more water. (Before buying this one, I had looked up which steamer to get, and an article said that this one was the best for steaming more clothes at once.) That definitely seems to be true. I still had a bit of water left after trying the steamer out on several clothes. It has a bar that you can use to, like, press the clothes like an iron does (like ironing vertically without using a board). I like that feature because it seems to help if you need to press something down that is either sticking up or has a crease somewhere that you don't want. (I tried it on a light to medium blouse that always had a weird crease in the lace-like part, and it got that out.) I also like that this steamer can steam vertically or horizontally. It gets very hot and does a good job of getting out the wrinkles! I tried it on heavier jeans-like pants and it worked well on those. It has a low and high setting. It comes with different attachments, which is nice. I'm pleased, and it seems as if it'll actually be fun to prep my clothes! (The steamer says that it has a three-year warranty.)","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Burst Style: Steam Burst  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-05-13 15:43:13"},{"user":"Helen Johnson","content":"This steamer has a long cord, which makes it easier to reach all the garment.It holds more water, so steam lasts longer than than most hand-held models.It also heats up very quickly, which is a plus for me.It is a little heavier than some travel steamers, but if you have extra room in your luggage, it does a great job.
