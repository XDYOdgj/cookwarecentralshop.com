The J-4000 is one of the best purchases that I have made!I recommend this steamer to anyone that wants a steamer that really works!",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"yvettemarie16","content":"I wanted a steamer to finally ditch my dry cleaner. At $5 a shirt/sweater, dry cleaning was costing a fortune, and not to mention the chemicals, and my clothes kept coming back with static, odd stains, and sweaters hung instead of folded. So, I figured Id ditch the dry cleaner and steam instead.I bought the J-4000M steamer after much research and reading reviews, and I am NOT disappointed! I wanted a professional steamer to use at home because I had bought a much cheaper version (not a Jiffy) before, and it didnt steam properly and \"spit\" water out. So this time I opted to go for the J-4000M (with the metal attachment). Although it was more expensive than the J-2000M, I knew I wanted a professional version, like the kind used in retail clothing stores. I honestly don't know how much of a difference there is between the two models...but other reviews I read were mixed, some said not much of a difference, others said there was. So i cant comment on any differences. I also opted for the metal head, over the plastic, only because I personally feel the metal gets hotter and hence produce a better result...but I am no expert and cant say for sure if metal is better than plastic.As far as the steamer itself goes...its solid construction and very well made! It was easy to put together, nothing to it really. (look under the steamer for the wrench that is attached via a magnet). But really it was just a matter screwing the metal rods together and attaching to the tank, and screwing the hose on (the head came already attached to the hose). THATS IT...pretty easy! This thing is heavy duty! But not heavy and its on wheels so its easy to move around. I had read some reviews that said it was too heavy...but I didnt find that to be a problem at all. unless you plan on carrying the thing around...but no need because there are wheels. Perhaps if you need to empty the water out...? I, however, like to do all my clothing at the same time...so I fill it up and steam til it runs dry...so I never need to empty it. Just dont add more water than you need and you should be fine. The handle is made of wood, which is heaver than plastic, but I didnt find it to feel heavy while using, nor did it get hot in the whole 2 hours I steamed.As far as the steam.....yes, it does take about 15 min to pre-heat, but Im ok with that. Once its preheated, you switch to steam, and within 2 minutes, its steaming. The tank takes up to 4 quarts. I didnt time it, but I got about 2 hours on a full tank. I can do ALOT of clothes on 1 tank. I did cotton shirts, rayon, polyester, sweaters, linen, fabric blends, dress slacks and it ALL came out perfectly steamed and very easily! I was a steaming fool!! The ONLY small complaint (if I have to give one), is that the rod could be a bit taller. Otherwise, no complaints. Im in love with this steamer!I highly recommend this steamer!! And the best part is that with the money Im saving on dry cleaning this thing pays for itself in no time!","purchase_model":"Style:  Metal Steam Head Style: Metal Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-11-03 15:43:09"},{"user":"B. MAHTANI","content":"The Jiffy J-4000 Proline steamer is a daunting purchase for a recently graduated businessman who hates ironing.At $200 from Amazon, the cost of purchasing one of these things is the cost of about 100 dry cleaned and pressed shirts (about 6 months worth) at the local dry cleaners.However, I decided to give it a try, knowing that I could return it if I hated it.The steamer arrived 4 days after I ordered it, thanks to Amazon's free and fast shipping. Putting it together was a joke, and within 10 minutes I was preheating the water.(A word of advice, let the machine preheat all the way before turning it to steam mode.)I am currently used to turning the preheat on before I shower, then turning it to steam immediately when I get back to my room, and it will be ready when I need to use it.Using the machine seems simple, but there is a method that seems to work best.First, make sure you are sitting down.You can't use it standing up, and kneeling is uncomfortable.I used my computer chair, and that worked great.Once the preheat indicator turns off, turn the dial to steam.It will take a few minutes before steam starts coming out of the nozzle, so be patient.Once you see the steam, it's ready to go.I don't steam any women's clothing, so this is solely catered to males.Hold one end of one sleeve and work the nozzle down the sleeve horizontally.Do this twice.Then move to the front of the shirt.Hold the shirt at the bottom, and move the nozzle slowly down the shirt.You don't have to press the nozzle deeply into the shirt.Just hold it directly against, and even slightly off the shirt.Continue to the other side, then to the other sleeve, then turn the shirt around and do the back.Th entire process for 1 long sleeved dress shirt is about 8 minutes.A t-shirt takes about 2.This beast of a machine dissolves the toughest wrinkles fairly easily.Of course, the thinker the material, the longer it will take to steam, but overall, the machine is great and should last for a long time, making it one of the best purchases I have ever made.","purchase_model":"Style:  Plastic Steam Head Style: Plastic Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2010-05-04 15:43:09"},{"user":"Rima","content":"before I purchased this steamer I went online and read all the reviews to determine which one should I get the 2000 or the 4000. As many of the reviews mentioned that the 2000 is too weak to deliver iron like results, I went with the 4000 model. I am thrilled with the results that my first reaction was \" every woman deserves one of these!\" it works great on cotton, T-shirts and pants in particular. I'm even wearing some shirts and dresses that I'd stopped wearing before because they wrinkle so bad and they're hard to iron.I use it on my husbands collared shirts, it's not exactly the same results as ironing, more like 85 to 90% the same, which is enough result for me to give up ironing. I'm sure as I learn to use it better I will even get better results (it's already getting better and it's been only one month) point is that made me happy that I didn't get the J-2000 as it would have been definitely too weak to give similar result.the only thing I didn't readreviews about is whether to get the iron or the metal head. So after talking with the company I chose the metal one as it is more durable.. well that was a bad choice!the metal handle is extremely heavy and it gets really hot. it's so hard to handle and I feel that it's an accident waiting to happen. In order to get good results and prevent condensation in the hose, I hang the clothes up over the door. after steaming few pieces I get so tired and I stop for a break. I was at a store the other day and they had the J4000 with a plastic head and I asked to try it:- it's much much lighter-it's much easier to handle- it doesn't heat up and feels much saferthe only way for the head to break is if it's dropped real hard on the floor, I can't see how I could loose control over the plastic one while with the metal one I throw it every time I feel the heat from the metal and I get scared!it will cost me 71 dollars to get the plastic one, that's expensive and I wish I went with it from the beginning. However, it is worth it because I know that with it this steamer would be perfect.if you are to order the head without the hose you'd have to cut the hose that you have and connect that had which can be dangerous and is not recommended!I haven't used the iron for a month and I don't see me using it again in the futureI just love my Jiffy","purchase_model":"Style:  Metal Steam Head Style: Metal Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-08-17 15:43:09"},{"user":"C. Vergara","content":"I have owned many many steamers like Rowenta, ConAir, etc etc.The Jiffy Steamer is in a category by itself as one of the best steamers you can own.With the previous steamers I own, like Rowenta or ConAir, it steams up quick but doesn't hold the steam for long.So if you are going to steam 2-3 garments, then your OK.But if you are going to steam 10 garments everyday, Conair and Rowenta slows you down because the steam is not constant.It is only constant for a little while and you have to wait a few minutes until it gets steaming.The Jiffy Steamer on the other hand takes a very very long time to steam up, but once it starts going, it will not STOP compared to other brands I have used.As I have used this steamer for 2 months, I realize the way to make this Jiffy Steamer steam fast is to put not to much water.My suggestion is getting a large coke you get at McDonalds and filling that twice with distilled water.That way when you turn on the Jiffy Steamer, it will only take 5 minutes to heat up not 15 minutes.Also this steamer is built so strong that you can kick it and it won't break.This thing is made like a \"tank\" but I wish the company could make it look beautiful looking.But in any case beautiful or not, I will be a proud owner of the Jiffy steamer.Not going with any other brands.Also a note of warning.This steam is a lot hotter compared to Rowentaor ConAir steamers in my opinion.","purchase_model":"Style:  Plastic Steam Head Style: Plastic Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-01-21 15:43:09"},{"user":"Psychic Jane","content":"If you have thought of buying a high quality garment steamer, this is the one to get.There are a few things that aren't clear from the description that I thought I'd share.First, the reservoir can hold more than a gallon of water, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to be \"ready\" to steam - well, if you fill the reservoir completely, it takes about 15 minutes to heat up the water to be ready.The steam is HOT and continuously pumps out of the steamhead, until you turn the machine off, or on standby.And the reservoir holds enough water to continuously steam for about 2 hours.Don't think that you will be able to steam up your clothes each morning before you go to work, because of the impracticality of heating up the water for 15 minutes first (I suppose you could, but that wouldn't be a very environmentally-friendly usage of this great tool).What I did this weekend was spent about 45 minutes steaming just about everything in my closet that had the slightest wrinkle to it.I think this is the first time in my life I don't have anything in my closet that is wrinkled!This machine is going to save me a ton in dry cleaning bills because about half the time, my dry-clean-only clothes aren't exactly dirty, just wrinkled.But the steam also removes odors - I noticed this when I was steaming my draperies - the steam released a dusty/musty smell from the drapes while I was steaming them.Anyway, bottom line, this is a good buy.Easy to assemble and definitely a quality work horse.One down side is that it does have a rather large \"footprint\" so you will need a little space in your closet or laundry room to keep it handy and ready to rock.Good luck and enjoy!","purchase_model":"Style:  Plastic Steam Head Style: Plastic Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2005-05-01 15:43:09"},{"user":"Rose","content":"Don't buy anything else, this is a real commercial steamer, same as what's used in stores everywhere.If the price is too high save for it.Right out of the box, steamed a ton of clothes, suits, pants, jeans, cotton shorts, blouses, sweaters, polos, touched up a few of my son's wrinkled cotton shirts, worked insanely good! Took a fraction of the time it takes to iron and no need to disassemble when done.Takes about 10 minutes for the water to preheat then 2 for full steam but its well worth the wait.This is the real thing!!!Bought this to replace a Rowenta Commercial Precision Steamer which is the worst thing I've ever purchased, not only did it hardly work but I worked for it since it would not work unless you emptied, cleaned and removed the hose, tank and nozzle to air out every time you used it, not to mention you had to decalcify it almost every other time you used it.Waste if money, effort and time!!!I still can't get over how much better it works.Should have returned the Rowenta after the first time I used it, but part of my thought why bother buying another one if steamers don't work, boy was I wrong.No comparison at all.","purchase_model":"Style:  Metal Steam Head Style: Metal Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-08-11 15:43:09"},{"user":"stakeholder","content":"I bought this steamer to use in a steam table I built to soften glazing in old windows.

I do all collars and sleeves and then whiz though the bodies of the shirts with the steamer.I always wear gloves.The steam is HOT.I now LOVE this steamer in conjunction with some ironing.I still iron all pants but can steam golf shorts (because I can get the steamer inside the shorter leg easily). Steaming is great on interlock and pique knits and nylons and performance fabrics.My husband and I do a lot of sports so much of our clothing is of this variety.It's also great on cotton dress shirts, but as I said, the collars and sleeves need regular ironing.So don't plan on throwing away your iron if you buy the steamer, but do plan on getting good and fast results if you use both.Remember, it does take 15 minutes to get the steam to the right temperature to steam and you will need a hanging board for best results.I hang a heavy towel over my built-in ironing board door and that works fine.","purchase_model":"Style:  Plastic Steam Head Style: Plastic Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2009-06-26 15:43:09"},{"user":"Tamara K. Wenzel","content":"This Jiffy does an excellent job on the fine-gauge cashmere sweaters that I wear year-round in Florida.I have laundered my cashmere for many years, now using Mrs. Meyers, and previously ironed with a warm iron. Iron was adequate, and actually worked better than bothering with an inferior model of steamer.Now, this top-of-the-line Jiffy, on the inside of the cashmere, smoothes quickly, making ironing unnecessary and giving a more professional look.The primary reason for the purchase, however, was to tackle laundering my St. Johns tanks also.(Tanks need to be laundered with greater frequency than the jackets, at great expense.)Previous laundering attempts, with an inferior steamer, had produced inadequate results in removal of the embedded wrinkles in a St. Johns Collection wool weave.This Jiffy produced the steam/heat necessary.With instructions from my saleslady, I now launder a St. Johns tank with a little vinegar in the cold water to retain the color.I slowly steam the tank from the inside, with slow movements to remove the embedded wrinkles.I then \"finish\" the garment by laying a damp handkerchief-weave cotton cloth against the outside, and ironing. This gives the woven wool its pristine \"department-store\" sheen.The real benefit of owning this Jiffy is stains.Frequently, dry cleaners will not attempt St. Johns stains at all, especially those that have been sitting for very long, such as having been stained on a vacation.I had only owned the Jiffy for a few days when I stained a tank during dinner.That evening, I washed the stain out in cold water, knowing fully that, on my busy schedule in the coming week, I would have no time to get the garment to the dry cleaners, or to even finish the process myself.Yet, even several weeks later, I was able to restore the tank to its original beauty!This gives much freedom from anxiety in knowing that I have not permanently ruined a garment that is an integral part of a coordinated outfit.","purchase_model":"Style:  Plastic Steam Head Style: Plastic Steam Head  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2007-06-04 15:43:09"},{"user":"J","content":"I HATE to iron and I have purchased and returned 4 other steamers that claimed to be professional steamers, including the J-2000.I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the J-4000 knowing that it takes 15-20 minutes to get full strength steam and that it was heavier than most steamers (but it is on wheels to easily move around)...all of this is written clearly in the product description!I am so glad that I decided to try one last time and order the J-4000!It is absolutely incredible and worth every penny!I purchased clergy albs, cassocks and stoles that needed to be steamed to get the wrinkles out and not one of the other steamers did the job that the J-4000 has done.I don't know what I did without this steamer!The hose is completely flexible once it warms up and there is a great steady stream of steam produced once it is fully heated.If you are going to steam, perhaps those that think 15-20 minutes is too long to wait should plan accordingly and plug it in that much ahead of time so that it is ready to go when you need it.Otherwise, don't purchase the unit.
