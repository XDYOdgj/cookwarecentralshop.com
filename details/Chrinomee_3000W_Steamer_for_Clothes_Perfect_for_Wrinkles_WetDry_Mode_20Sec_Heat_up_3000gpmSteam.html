The only negative is the mitt to protect your hand from heat. Mine had a hole in it and just was kind of clunky. I will use something else.",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"Seco007","content":"This is the first time I have ever purchased a steamer for my clothes and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was looking for something easy to use and that I can conveniently take with me while I travel for work. This steamer did the trick! The iron heated up quickly in the morning and produce an abundant amount of steam that allowed me to quickly get out all of the wrinkles in my clothes before work. This product has allowed me to get ready for work much faster and continuously provides reliable end results.","purchase_model":"Color: black Color: black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-10-14 15:43:09"},{"user":"Michelle Garay","content":"This is so amazing!It\u2019s very easy to use, no burning yourself bcz it\u2019s very safe to use and it comes with a protective glove.It heats up fast, it\u2019s light in weight.It does a fabulous job!I use it for my curtains to my clothing and I will say it\u2019s worth every penny. And it wasn\u2019t expensive either so go get your chrinomee steamer you will not be disappointed!","purchase_model":"Color: white Color: white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-06 15:43:09"},{"user":"Ileana Manzanilla","content":"The steamer works as expected. It is a bit heavy, but does the work. It is a bit unclear what the two different settings do, but once you try each you will easily get a hang of what works best. I wouldn't travel with it given the size and weight, but it is a good steamer if you are only keeping it at home for daily stuff. Once you connect it, it will be ready to use in a few seconds.","purchase_model":"Color: white Color: white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-12 15:43:09"},{"user":"Chitown Chic","content":"I researched many many steamers and landed on this beauty for a couple reasons...the main reason was the fact that it is at least twice as powerful as many others and as a result takes much less time and the end result a wrinkle free garment, also light weight and not cumbersome to maneuver around a garment. Very satisfied with my purchase.","purchase_model":"Color: white Color: white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-08 15:43:09"},{"user":"Sheryl Lynn","content":"I started on my journey to use of a clothes steamer when my friend gushed about hers.Now she is much more anal about wearing perfectly ironed (I mean you can tell that she spends hours Ironing/Steaming her clothes).She gave me an old one to try, but she had forgotten that it had lost the ability to heat.So I went and purchased one and it didn't do anything.I think I got a wrinkle out just breathing on it in frusration.Well, I returned that one and bought another ~ this one more expensive.Well I repeated this insanity two more times ~ once with Amazon, and they were all too much work for the benefit.As I was preparing to return the first one that I bought through Amazon, this one caught my eye.It fell right in the middle as far as pricing goes, and had a sleek look to it.I gave it a try, and I am glad that I did.I especially like how it feels in my hand ~ although it is a bit heavier than the others I tried.It is super easy to get started,warms up very quickly, doesn't drip as two others had.The only negative I will comment on is the mitt.It's a nice \"bonus\" but I don't find it necessary.If you are on the fence, just give it a try.It's free to r3eturn it and you have 30 days to return it if you so choose.But I bet you will enjoy the same ease it provides to make clothes look like you care how you look.Something that I am still working on. LOL","purchase_model":"Color: white Color: white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-15 15:43:09"},{"user":"gloria","content":"For me, this is a really great steamer. Heats quickly, puts out alot of steam.It is also a plus that it can be a constant or controlled steam. It would be a definite plus is there were another foot to 18\" on the length of the cord.It is easy enough to fill when using the accompanying fill cup. You just need to take your time on the pour in.The mitt that comes with it is certainly not protective; as the steam blows right through it...ouch~But, lol, as I ordered the steamer for the steamer, the mitt really doesn't matterBut, I really dislike putting more needless waste into the earth.I use distilled H2O to prevent mineral deposits.I ordered a really nice and not overly exaggerated sized mitt for a good price, here on Amazon.A good mitt really makes a difference on how certain materials release wrinkles, and in allowing one to hit those more detailed areas.Not to forget making the using of the ironing aspect for spot pressing, a more effective experience, as opposed to breaking out an ironing board.All in all, a good - and reasonably priced purchase that I am very pleased with.I hope that it lasts a good long while.","purchase_model":"Color: black Color: black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-01-03 15:43:09"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Maravillosa compra !! Optimiza el tiempo y facilita el trabajo","purchase_model":"Color: white Color: white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-25 15:43:09"},{"user":"Lynne","content":"I am a reseller so I am always steaming clothing. I have a large professional steamer that I use but I get tired ofall the work it takes to use it & the maintenance. I thought I would try out a hand held one to see if it was easier and if it would do the job. Both of which it does very well. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to steam an article of clothing. It works fast and you don't have to wait for it to heat up. The only thing I would suggest to users is to use distilled water if you are steaming many items as over time, tap water can clog your machine and potentially transfer some of that chalky mineral buildup onto the delicate clothing you're steaming.","purchase_model":"Color: blue Color: blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-10-06 15:43:09"},{"user":"Biresh","content":"Very pleased with this product. My intent is to use this the steamer for those \"non\" iron clothes that have stretch to them. After washing such clothes you still have the manufacturer's creases in them and it's quite a struggle to remove them with an iron because of the location of the creases and you have to have a low temperature on the iron so you don't scorch the fabric. I have a lot of dresses that looked crumpled and wrinkly hanging in my closet. I would take them out and not wear them because of the way they looked\u2026.. lm not good at ironing and it takes so long. After using my steamer its like l have more dresses/choices to choose from! Its easy to use, it works!","purchase_model":"Color: blue Color: blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-10-06 15:43:09"},{"user":"Elizabeth Stewart","content":"I bought this so I could easily remove wrinkles on clothing that was hanging. The steamer does a fine job on hanging items and on surfaces. I also use it to remove wrinkles from quilt fabric. it is much lighter than my professional iron and easy to use. I will probably end up giving it to my college student to use- who needs a big ironing board/expensive iron anymore? It's lightweight and takes up almost zero storage space. The only negative is the mitt to protect your hand from heat. Mine had a hole in it and just was kind of clunky. I will use something else.","purchase_model":"Color: black Color: black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-12 15:43:09"}];
