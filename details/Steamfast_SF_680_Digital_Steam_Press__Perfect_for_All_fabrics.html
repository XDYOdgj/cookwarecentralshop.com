Drop the sleeve and release it so you’ll run a crease along the stitched part of the sleeve, located at the bottom.Eyeball for a correct seam.One steam and press usually suffices; there is usually no need to flip the sleeve to iron the other side.Repeat on the other sleeve.I tried to improve the efficiency of pressing the sleeve by cutting a piece of cardboard 36” inches long and droppingit into the sleeve hole before pressing. (I rounded one end of the cardboard to make the drop easier.) It was easy enough to correctly align the cardboard for an accurate seam, but the technique also confirmed the rumor that wet corrugated cardboard smells like — yes, yes — poo.I’m searching for other kinds of cardboard.Anyway, shirts turn out great.Almost all time is spent on waiting for the steam/press time.I listen to an Audibe book as I iron and have pleasant memories of my grandmother sitting at her Iron-Rite listening to Ma Perkins Boarding House.The Steamfast itself seems to be of high quality.The steam reservoir is large and easily refillable.I’m at the point where I’m ready to firm up some of the creases with small amounts of spray starch, but even without starch, the shirts hold up well.Remnants of the creases in the sleeves seem to hold up through a machine wash.And at no time have I detected a transfer of the smell of — you know — from the corrugated cardboard.",

Great buy and quick shipping!","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-04 15:43:08"},{"user":"D. Dell","content":"I use this Press mostly for jeans. It does the job well and is faster than using an iron. Here's more details:When using on jeans I usually only have to press one side. Hence, the shorter time spent pressing. I keep a spray bottle of water handy just in case. However, the built-in steaming usually does the job of getting stubborn wrinkles out. And many times I don't have to use the steam at all. Keep in mind that when using the steam you have to pull the top down to within 3 - 4 inches away from your fabric, press the steam button for 2 or 3 seconds then release the steam button and lower the top onto your fabric. Never press the steam button while top is in contact with the fabric (closed position). That could damage the machine.The water container is sealed which comes in handy because I store the unit upright on its base. It also has a locking feature when closed to allow you to carry or store the unit.I like the easy to use digital heat setting and the warning sound that will alert you when the top is down for more that 7 - 8 seconds. It will also shut off after several minutes of being idle. Hint: Each time you plug the unit in, the lowest heat setting is the default.For more precise pressing in hard to do and small places, you may want to keep a regular iron handy. Personally, I haven't done that yet. But, I could see where the extra smaller iron would be needed.If you have never tried a Steam Press, I highly recommend that you at least give it a try. You just might be glad you did.","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-10-06 15:43:08"},{"user":"mememeT","content":"OK so I'm gonna really really love this *for what I need it for* (knit shells, sweaters, T's, shelf-stuff, some heavier cotton pants perhaps (untested pants).First, as reviews get switched between different versions of an item, I will share I purchased:Steam Fast SF-680 Digital Fabric Steam Press, April 2015.I need to shave off some a.m. gettin out the door time, so I first got this press, and next I may get the 30-45 minutes pants creasing press still thinking on that one.I opened this box (wide, but not too heavy or awkward in case you were wondering), and I had this item working in five minutes.It's not too heavy really it isn't (I was a little concerned about that initially). Only two pages of a small manual really applied to \"use\" and they were very well written.Skimmed the manual and in only minutes I was confident enough to steam blast my way through a sleeveless cream sweater.I wear very simple clothes to work, and alot of knits - thin sweaters etc.I don't often wear woven shirts with collars, so I won't be using it for those.I like my knits folded like on the store shelves-- so today I folded half and flattened (steam-shot lower, count to 8 and lift), folded half again and flattened (steam shot two lower, count to 8 and lift) - bam-bam-bam top done and just like new off the shelf!How awesome!Used wool setting for all, no issues no scorching, no wierd creasing, no burns.Steam puffs out fine.Some reviewers noticed loud popping noise, and yes I heard a total of \"three\" mid-range pops but that may very well be something metal underneath just reacting to a very fast heating up/cooling down. My little handheld steam iron does that but tiny-tiny pings only so it may make sense - bigger metal plate makes bigger popping noise.In my case, I had press on a total of 15 minutes, heard three pops total.Not unsettling, and likely wouldn't have noticed them had I not read the reviews before buying it.Actually, it says 8-10 seconds down, but counting to three did just as well with my knits.Started with \"wool\" but turned it down to \"silk\"The three lowest choices including \"silk\" allow no steam shot, but one wouldn't want that anyway on those.Tried a shirt, used a little Bounce starch, they came out ok but gonna need a little flattening practice on them, and I don't wear them often so I may just twist around and use the regular iron 5 times a year smiles.But the knits?Oh baby, am I gonna love this thing.Some reviews have mentioned you really really need the stand due to instability lifting/lowering the handle. Stand is sold separately here for like $50.Happy I didn't get it, because for me its just not necessary.For me, this press fits totally great on the top of my front-load dryer, extra room all around it, I can even pull out the top-side lint trap filter with no issues, and even with the steam press open. In fact, I have two shelves sticking out over my dryer and there's still plenty of room for this press sittin there totally open.Weight on the dryer top is fine, balance is fine, and press is seemingly built tight as a drum no issues with instability using it/opening/closing.So in my case, I needed this for morning \"speed\", \"fit\" in a convenient room, \"safety\" (steam, burns) as I'm gonna be using it quickly, \"durability\", a few years of no-drama working as advertised, and of course not burning my clothes or me unpredictably.So long as it keeps working like it did today, I'm thrilled with my purchase.Final thought:I took 2 suit jackets/matching trousers to the dry cleaners three weeks ago - the best dry cleaner in town they say. I paid and retrieved my plastic-draped goods and happily headed home.Hung em up at the house, and the morning of an awards ceremony three days later I pulled the plastic off to find it seemed like they cleaned them but did not press them - the collars were not flattened, the pants had no seams. Really?My response for my time, money, and initiation of \"Plan B\"?First time shame on you, second time its on me, so to avoid future drama I came to Amazon and done done and done. And this is also why I am a card-carrying Prime/2-day shipping included member as well.Hope that helps someone, and wishing all well!","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-04-19 15:43:08"},{"user":"W Brown","content":"I frequently wear collared shirts which I starch and iron by hand.Using this method, I cannot get the fine wrinkles out completey, so I purchased the press with the hopes that the press would eliminate the fine wrinkles and give a more professional look.Even taking great time and care to smooth out the garment, I found that I am unable to get the results I want.Some shirts that have puffy and gathered sleeves are impossible to use on the press with even mediocre results so I have to take those back to the standard ironing board.I have only used the press several times since getting it so maybe there is something I am missing in operating the press.No video or instructions came with the machine.Bottom line: I wanted a more professional look with this press, and it doesn't deliver. I also iron my knit tops and t-shirts and sweaters, and the press works superbly on those garments and saves a lot of time and produces excellent results with those items, but I purchased it mainly for the collared shirts.I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW, AND I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE MY REVIEW AND GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS.I LOVE MY STEAMPRESS.I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO COLLARED SHIRTS BETTER THAN A REGULAR IRON, BUT ON EVERYTHING ELSE, THIS MACHINE IS AMAZING.I IRON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING NOW, AND IT TAKES SO LITTLE TIME.I ENJOY IRONING USING THIS PRESS.I DO NOT LIKE THE STEAM FUNCTION ON THE MACHINE SO I USE A SPRAY BOTTLE OCCASIONALLY ON HEAVILY WRINKLED GARMENTS, AND THAT WORKS FINE.I ALSO HAVE USED THE STAND THAT I GAVE A POOR RATING, AND I NEED TO REVISE THAT RATING AS WELL BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD EVER USE IT FOR ANYTHING BUT FOR STORING THE PRESS.THE TOP OF THE PRESS DOES SPRING BACK AND ROCKS THE STAND SLIGHTLY, BUT AFTER USING THE PRESS A FEW TIMES, YOU LEARN HOW TO RAISE THE TOP SO THAT IT DOESN'T ROCK.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STEAM PRESS, AND I WOULD GIVE THE STAND ABOUT 4 STARS.","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-12-14 15:43:08"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"This is a replacement for a 34 inch Kaloric that I ordered a month ago.The Kaloric's opening was so small (only about 6 inches in the front and 2 inches in the back when fully opened) that I burned my hands several times and I am very experienced at using a presser.I have used a steamer for several years until it died recently.I highly recommend them and use mine everyday.This model is great.The pressing area is a little larger than my old model at 25x10 and is really the perfect size for ironing shirts and pants.Although the 34 inch was good for the inseam, it was really too large for almost everything else.Once you have a system down, you can press everything very quickly.I pressed a fitted queen size sheet in about four minutes and the top sheet just as quickly.The trick is to fold it carefully and press them in sections.Another nice thing is that this model presses several layers at one time so you can put a knit tee shirt on the unit and get the back and frontin one press.I have only had it about a week - so I don't know how long it will last - but it seems to be of good quality.My old presser last almost 3 years - I hope this one does as well.The shipping was very quick - it arrived in about 3 days and Amazon was great about taking back the 34 inch Kaloric without hesitation.I am very pleased.","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2010-08-04 15:43:08"},{"user":"Erik","content":"Such a great product.

Drop the sleeve and release it so you\u2019ll run a crease along the stitched part of the sleeve, located at the bottom.Eyeball for a correct seam.One steam and press usually suffices; there is usually no need to flip the sleeve to iron the other side.Repeat on the other sleeve.I tried to improve the efficiency of pressing the sleeve by cutting a piece of cardboard 36\u201d inches long and droppingit into the sleeve hole before pressing. (I rounded one end of the cardboard to make the drop easier.) It was easy enough to correctly align the cardboard for an accurate seam, but the technique also confirmed the rumor that wet corrugated cardboard smells like \u2014 yes, yes \u2014 poo.I\u2019m searching for other kinds of cardboard.Anyway, shirts turn out great.Almost all time is spent on waiting for the steam/press time.I listen to an Audibe book as I iron and have pleasant memories of my grandmother sitting at her Iron-Rite listening to Ma Perkins Boarding House.The Steamfast itself seems to be of high quality.The steam reservoir is large and easily refillable.I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m ready to firm up some of the creases with small amounts of spray starch, but even without starch, the shirts hold up well.Remnants of the creases in the sleeves seem to hold up through a machine wash.And at no time have I detected a transfer of the smell of \u2014 you know \u2014 from the corrugated cardboard.","purchase_model":"Style:  Steam Press Style: Steam Press  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-03-04 15:43:08"}];
