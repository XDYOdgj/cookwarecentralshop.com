I don't have to use as many poisonous or abrasive chemicals.2. I can clean a floor with 1 - 2 cups of water, depending on the size of the room and cleaning job needed. This is much better than a mop bucket full of water and chemicals, that I need to dump out each time I clean a room.3. This is so versatile, efficient and time saving.Its compact and thus space saving.It's also comes with numerous attachments that allow you to move from floors to counters to really hard grime between tiles. I will still keep using disinfectants, but this is a really good deep cleaning or quick cleaning machine that doesn't require chemicals.The one thing I recommend is to get a small storage box or container to store the attachments in.They don't include a bag or container with the set.I would buy this again, for sure.Also, get a rubber glove and old towel.I found that the handle gets hot (doesn't burn) during extended cleanings and a towel helps for wiping away grime, when cleaning tile and grout.I use a rubber mechanic glove and it works just fine.As a note of caution, do not open the valve on the water container until the steamer has had an hour of more time to cool down. The pressure build up is comparable to taking a radiator cap off in a car.You could end up with burns and a big mess.The manufacturer provides instructions for relieving the pressure in the system when you have finished using it.",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"tom4416","content":"I've only used this once so review could change over time but out of the box, it is very impressive.First, it makes a lot of high pressure steam, such that you really need to be careful to not scald yourself.Quality tools and spare mopheads available from the manufacturer.I wanted it mainly for countertops and it is perfect because it lets you use the wide floor mop tool directly on the handle (no extension tubes needed) and it does a beautiful job of cleaning and disinfecting my kitchen countertops.My next project is to attached the brass brush head and go after my BBQ grates and then to do the inside of the oven door - these are acid test projects and if it successfully cleans these, it's a pure homerun of a product (assuming good durability).My only initial concern is the hose.It seems a bit flimsy but is exactly like the hoses on most of the other cleaners.I'm hoping that it is somehow user replaceable down the road and that the manufacturer sells the part.Update:12/29/2018.Went to use the squeegee attachment and the rubber blade tore in half.Could have been me putting too much pressure on it but looked like a defective piece of rubber.Contacted the company and told them they could just send the rubber blade, felt confidentI could replace it but they wanted to send me a whole new squeegee attachment and apologized for the inconvenience.Can't get better support than that.I did attack my BBQ grates with the brass brush head and it worked like a charm.I do kind of wish you could control the level of steam as this unit produces a lot and it's under a lot of pressure.And then I discovered a new use for the product - cleaning athletic shoes that are the mesh fabric.Invariably my athletic shoes get dirty and the mesh is just about impossible to thoroughly clean and they end up being unsightly and my wife throws them away when I'm not looking.Well, I had some stains starting to show on my most recent pair and decided to try this steam cleaner with one of the soft plastic brushes.I put a shoe tree into each shoe to have a firm background against which to push and went to town.It works!Takes a little time and patience but it cleans the grime right out of the mesh, making the shoes look new again.Only thing I have found that works.Update 03/27/2022:Unit is now over 3 years old and has continued to perform flawlessly and it gets used on a weekly basis to clean a variety of items in the house, my granite countertops being perhaps the most important.I only use purified water (reverse osmosis) in the machine so no scale buildup.It's gone up a lot in price since I bought mine but would buy it all over again if this one failed.For those complaining about the quality of the components, relax.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2018-12-21 15:43:15"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Reasons I purchased: Primary cause- a \"house guest\" brought bedbugs. While the infestation was small, we have yet to completely eliminate the little sobs, and I refuse to let the enemy win. After heat treating, poisoning, applications ofdiatomaceous earth, removing furniture and carpet cleaning until the dye came out of the carpet, they would disappear for a few days to a week. Then come back. I will not submit. This enemy will be eliminated at all costs.Secondary cause- I hate cleaning. I am an old, overweight male with better things to do than spend copious amounts of time in physical positions I can barely achieve, scrubbing filth. When I do it, I am completely anal about it. OCD level cleaning is achieved and then I expect to spend the minimum amount of time maintaining that level of cleanliness.Also, my wife insists on owning disgusting little beta dogs that refuse to do things real dogs do, like relieve themselves outside whenever there is a storm within three hundred miles, a snowflake, or morning dew that might dampen their \"widdle paws\". I like animals. I hate these little hamster half breeds with a passion and only put up them because I love that woman. Moving on.After researching what I wanted and seemed affordable, I purchased this model, Steamfast SF-370WH, and it arrived this morning. Reading the reviews, I expected several things regarded as negative. After using this unit, I found none of those things.1. \"The accessories are cheap and useless after the first use.\"Nope. You're doing it wrong. ANY bristle brush, nylon or brass, will become destroyed if you put all your weight on it. The steam is providing the power to loosen and flush away the dirt. The bristles are their to provide \"GENTLE\" agitation, like a sales person in a department store. If it isn't coming off, move a little slower and let the steam work. If that doesn't do it, get a scrubby pad and spend three seconds doing labor. What's wrong with you?2. \"The unit and accessories are low quality and break.\"*Facepalm. It is a hundred dollar, home use steam cleaner. Are you going to clean a subway with it? No. The unit and parts fit nice and snug and are of reasonable quality provided you don't meat fist things together like a mentally challenged gorilla. The type of person that thinks like this complains if it takes longer than three minutes to get fast food. Don't force things. Refer to point one. I am sure you could get something that would allow for more applications of force, but not for this price. If you take your time and do it right, no damage will occur.3. \"I couldn't get it to clean anything.\"Ok, that might have actually been a defective unit. OR, maybe you didn't let if get up to temp. Once you start pulling the trigger, you are bleeding off pressure and that will increase the time it takes for the element to create adequate steam. As the internal pressure of a fluid decreases, the internal temperature decreases. Give it ten minutes to reach temp before you use it.So what I found:There is plenty of good hot steam for any application I plan on using this for. I thought I would test it on the stove as it has not been properly cleaned for quite awhile.I started with the nylon brush, I don't know why I just did, alright? It was clearly cleaning and not doing a bad job, but it could have been better. Then I used the brass brush tip. Holy crap. It looks brand new. I used it around the back of the sink where its a pita to get a sponge. Two passes and it looks like I just installed a new faucet. I had filled the tank to just below full and used at least 45 minutes of continuous steam. I used most of that tank of water on the stove, and it still isn't clean. Not because the unit doesn't work, but because the stove is that filthy. I had no Idea how bad it was. I went around cleaning spots all over the kitchen that had just been cleaned with pine stuff and elbow grease, and this thing made it look like these surfaces had never been touched. They look brand new. Now I have to clean the whole friggin' kitchen to match the clean spots. But first, the bugs.One place they have been hiding is in a crack in my desk where the main surface of the desk joins a trim piece. It is about five feet long. I have put a hot air gun in the crack. Sprayed poison in the crack. Vacuumed the crack. Again, gone for awhile and then they come back.I used a flash light and magnifying glass and located 3 of the little monsters in the crack. I blew on them and they wiggled and squatted. Alive. I lined up the nozzle, pulled the trigger and blasted every piece of debris from one end of the crack to the other over about eight seconds, INCLUDING THE THREE BEDBUGS and guess what? DEAD. They are commonly found under the mattress in one bedroom. I flipped the mattress and found two. Again, I just sprayed the box spring with raw steam, and both died instantly. I steamed along the seam of the mattress. I had just vacuumed the seam after spraying poison on it about two nights ago. After steaming them, I inspected under then seam and found 4 more dead bedbugs, all deceased.The bodies have been collected and will be watched for any signs of life, but at this point, I am going to call this a win. Bugs, welcome to Hiroshima. I am using a marker to write \"Enola Gay\" on the side of this steamer.Things I didn't like so much:There isn't anything built in to hold the accessories. Not a big deal.The fill cap could be bigger, but it really can't. The tank is under high pressure. In order to seal it, it needs to be a high pressure brass fitting. In order to use an adequate fitting without inflating the cost, they used a smaller fitting. Get a funnel.BTW, that is why you need to wait until it is cool before refilling. Steam pressure blowing the cap across the room and taking the whiny teenager's eye out, while funny, could be expensive and actually not that funny. I maybe shouldn't have said that.That's is it. I could tear it apart and say it isn't as good as \"X\", but it costs much less than ''X\" and gives you the same cleaning performance. If you're a picky person about cosmetic appearance and not having to think about what you're doing, this unit isn't for you. If you want something that will give you steam cleaning at a reasonable price and are careful about your operation and assembly, this thing should work just fine.UPDATE: After over 6 months, it still works fine. I am a sevice technician and spend a lot of time in fast food and sit down restaurant kitchens. I have taken this little steamer to places where cleaning us not exactly a priority for the staff. I replaced an o-ring on the tank filler cap. That is it. And riding around in the back of a service van is not an easy evironment. Still working fine and saving me time. Also, the Bedbug thing. In additon to the steamer, use Harris Bedbug killer. Of all the stuff I used, the combination of steam and that spray (can) finally did it. Steam and spray about once a week for about 3 weeks. They won't be back.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-07-07 15:43:15"},{"user":"Three Dog Circus","content":"This steam cleaner was purchased, initially, to clean the metal bars of a bird cage so we don't have to take the entire cage apart once a week, fill the bath tub, soak it, scrub it, put it back together.5/8/13It just arrived today and so far I've cleaned a grimy, wooden, outside windowsill, the grout in my shower and the build up around the base of the faucet and water knobs of my bathroom sink. It cleaned them perfectly and quickly. After cleaning them you just wipe the area with a cloth or if you're outside, spray it down with the hose to run the dirt off.I filled the tank and waited about 5 minutes for the unit to heat up. I was using the \"jet\" attachment and it seemed to work really well. The only thing I noticed was that if you set the nozzle/handle down for a little and then go back to use it again, you get a little spurt of mist/water. It didn't bother me at all and doesn't cause any problems but for cleaning some things it might be bad to have that happen so I thought I'd put that here to make people aware.So far, so good!5/26/13When they say not to remove the cap from the water tank without letting the machine sit and cool down for at least 10 minutes, they seriously mean it! I got impatient and threw a bath towel over the machine and took the cap off slowly to let it release the steam slowly and still when I got to the end it blew the towel in the air with a huge jet of super hot steam. Definitely use a thick bath towel over the machine if you absolutely have to open it without giving it time to cool down, otherwise you could have some very damaged skin. But if it's at all possible I would let it cool down first before opening it again.I used the steamer with the jet attachment to clean the grout on my bathroom floor. And this is a ton of seriously dirty grout between very small tiles so there's a TON of it. It does take a while, the jet is a very small, fine stream of steam. It's just really cool to see all the dirt it blows out of the grout. Still no complaints!The only thing I wish this had that it doesn't is something to make the stream of steam larger. Like a flat attachment that makes a flat stream of steam ~2 or 3 inches long. That would be helpful for cleaning larger areas but I guess it wouldn't be able to have as much pressure.. Hm. Just a thought.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-05-08 15:43:15"},{"user":"Green225","content":"Our master bathroom suffers from a lack of ventilation - no window and a weak exhaust fan. Over the 7 years we've been in the house it has always been a challenge to prevent mildew from building up. But in recent months we've noticed that a gradual buildup has been taking place on the tile and floor in the shower and decided a good steam cleaning might bring it back to normal.We bought the Steamfast because we had previously owned a Shark, but found the only thing the Shark ever did well was steam wrinkles out of new clothes. It eventually blew up while doing that dainty task so we knew when it came to buying a new steam cleaner we were going to do our due diligence and find a better brand. And that's how we came to settle on the the Steamfast - consistently high reviews from people who took the time to share their experience on Amazon.comRight out of the box, I could tell the quality between this and our old Shark was like night and day. It was easy to assemble, directions on how to use it were concise, and it lived up to our expectations.I steamedthe tile and grout in our shower from top to bottom and the results were better than I anticipated. Not only did it get rid of the mildew, but it also fleshed out a small area of black mold in the grout at the base of the shower where the tile meets the floor.I did all of this with a single tank of distilled water and still had enough left to clean the white caulking along the baseboards and around the bathtub. Still not empty - so I decided to try it on the 2 sink faucets and the shower faucet as well - immaculate.The Steamfast seems to be able to stand up to any task you put it to. I just finished cleaning the grout between the tiles of the kitchen floor. The floor attachment with the supplied cleaning pad did wonders on that floor. It's very difficult to notice the buildup of dirt over a long period of time until you've cleaned it. Our kitchen floor looks as good as it did the day we moved in.The money we spent on the Steamfast has already been returned by the dividends we've received from it's ability to clean so many different areas of our home - areas that we would have spent hundreds of dollars on to have professionals come in and do the same thing.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-02-06 15:43:15"},{"user":"Brandon Troupe","content":"I've never steamed something before so this review is from an inexperienced user.The packaging of the product inside the box wasn't the best as it seemed like some things were just sort of tossed into the box without a \"home\". Nothing looks like it was ever used though so either the packaging department is lazy/rushed or it all shifted around in shipping. Either way, nothing was broken or damaged so not that big of a deal.Set up was very easy. You get a graduated cylinder with a pour spout to fill the tank which is nice. However, the tank has such a small hole that it's difficult to pour from the cylinder into the tank without spilling. Would be nice if this came with a funnel.Build quality of the steamer is pretty good I think. The tank portion of the steamer is sturdy and feels solid. But the handle and trigger feel a LITTLE cheap. However, the steamer is easily actuated by a button on top of the handle. The button can be pressed on and off and will, or it can be locked in the on position which is handy. The handle gets pretty warm, but nothing that I would consider too hot to touch. It just feels like it could probably be insulated better. Also, it would be nice if the trigger was activated by your forefinger instead of your thumb. But this could just be personal preference as my thumb easily tires out in the position you have to hold the button down on this handle.The attachments feel like they're pretty well made and there are definitely a variety of them. I don't believe this is designed to be use on furniture and fabrics but I bought it for that purpose based on past reviews. I have an old couch and ottoman that needed some refreshing. After vacuuming the surface to lift most of the dirt and dust and cat hair, I used the squeegee attachment to steam the fabric and foam cushions. The only attachment that worked for this was the squeegee attachment, which did make it a little awkward but I managed to make it work. This steamer would definitely benefit from a furniture cleaning attachment. Just needs to be a flat, wide, duckbill looking nozzle. Anyway, if you need to steam a couch, use the squeegee to do it.I didn't test the temperature of the steam, but it feels like it gets plenty hot. The surface of the couch was heckin warm for a couple seconds after you pass over it with steam. I have no idea how well this is actually cleaning though. I moved the steamer across the fabric in slow steady streaks, up and down, side to side, etc. When I was done the couch smelled like musty fabric instead of skin oil and sweat and dirt. So yay, I think?A lot of reviews seem to say something along the lines of \"this drips water!\" Well, yeah. At least it does from the nozzle end. Steam is going to collect and condense and turn back into water. If it collects on the nozzle itself, then it's going to drip from the nozzle. So, yeah. I wouldn't expect a steamer to not drip water at some point.Very happy with this. I feel like it revitalized my old couch. Weather or not it actually did anything to clean and sanitize the fabric and foam is a mystery since I've never done this before and have no way of testing the before and after conditions. But, I feel way more comfortable sitting on this couch now that it's been steamed than I did before when it was dusty, dirty, and covered in cat hair and sweat.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-10-22 15:43:15"},{"user":"Cannin314","content":"I've used this once so far, but I'm horribly pleased.(I'll update later if we end up breaking up.)I purchased a much cheaper hand-held steamer (http://www.amazon.com/DBTech-Multi-Purpose-Pressurized-Sanitizing-Attachments/dp/B005SI8YZC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1427453358&sr=8-4&keywords=hand+steamer) and although I was initially pleased with that one I quickly was able to see the negatives.For a short while I decided I didn't need a steamer, but as time went on my dirty gross kitchen grout got the better of me and I decided to try to a larger steamer.After reading reviews and being indecisive I finally settled on this item.I immediately could tell how much easier cleaning the grout was going to be with this better model.My grout came much cleaner, much faster than the cheap item.My biggest gripe is that I had to \"use up\" both of the plastic scrubber heads to clean my grout because I was scrubbing pretty hard.I'll have to see if I can order replacements from the company for next time.(Although I purchased better grout sealer this time so hopefully it doesn't get as dirty!)I was going to re-seal the grout after cleaning so I was going pretty crazy trying to get it 100% perfect.When I was finished cleaning my grout I was having so much fun I decided to play around a little more.I tried to clean my sliding glass doors, but honestly this was a little messy.You end up with water dripping all over.It might work GREAT for outside windows where you don't care about the water dripping as much.(Or its entirely possible I was doing something wrong).But as far as my inside windows, I think I'll stick to windex.Then I decided to wash the whole floor with the pads provided.I also previously swore I needed a steamer to clean my tiles (not just the grout) so I ordered this: http://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Enviro-Hard-Surface-Steamer-313A/dp/B001LYFBHG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1427453708&sr=8-4&keywords=floor+steamerI was not pleased.For whatever reason it left streaks all over the floor.It was just water, I couldn't figure it out. When I called to return it the person I talked to said they had the shark steamer and it did the same thing.On dark tiles only. I was glad she said this because I was considering replacing it with the shark.I gave up on a steamer to clean my tile at that point.Since I already had this I figured it would be stupid to at least not try it.Well I'm so pleased that I did.No streaks, it was amazing.Now if I can use this to steam my sari's I'll be the happiest girl ever.(Because I can't Iron, and Saris have a lot of fabric that needs to be ironed before wearing)","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-03-27 15:43:15"},{"user":"shauna","content":"I needed an affordable steam cleaner to rid my condo of an infestation of bed bugs. Pest control companies estimated $1500-$3000. We cant afford that so, after tons of research, I found the only way to really kill all these things and eggs is with either extreme heat or extreme cold. So, I designed a way to affordably fumigate my condo, myself. If you dont have the money to afford a pest company, this worked for me. However, believe me when I say, this will take an extreme amount of time and hard work and you will have to be diligent for several weeks afterwards. It's similar to lice infestations. Here's what I did. Read as many reviews of every steam cleaner i could find. Every one of them had both good/bad reviews so in the end, I chose this specific machine for 3 reasons. 1-the affordable price, 2-a mans review of this particular model. He had a few bed bugs and he wrote in great detail, how he got rid of them.3. Covid19 hit California hard and in San Diego county only essential workers were allowed to work. I needed a way to sanitize/disinfect my home daily (I have 3 kids-17yo, 14yo and 7yo).So I took a chance and bought this model along with the Harris Bed bug kit(2 sprays and a powder with brush).Everything arrived 2-3 weeks earlier than expected (due to Covid19). Everything shipped, unless it was considered an essential item was expected to be delayed.Bought several ex-large latch type storage and EX-Large blue Ziploc bags (home depot), air matresses for everyone, a ton of cooking oil and 20 gallons of distilled water. First, I began drying all clothes/linens/shoes/purses/backpacks, in drawers or closets for minimum of 30 mins on high heat. As soon as each load was done, I refolded (straight out of the dryer) and packed them in storage bins. Stacking them in the garage. Each kid and adult was given one blue ziploc bag to put a weeks worth of clothing to be sealed and kept in the house during the process. I then, vacuumed, cleaned, sanitized and lastly, rearranged my living room so that all the inflated air matresses fit. Then, I poured a thick stream of cooking oil all around the perimeter of the air matresses as a sort of moat. the bugs would die in the oil trying to get to the air matresses. This is how we slept til the whole house was cleaned. I started in the room farthest from the front door and worked my way to the front. Steam cleaning, everything including the wall and ceiling, twice. Right before moving to the next room I, used the harris bed bug products. we have vaulted and popcorn ceilings, so this was challenging and time consuming. You have to \"follow up\" and do it all again weekly for about a month. Longer, like 2-3 months and more frequently, like every other day, if your infestation is truly bad. #1 RULE to remember: Nothing comes into a cleaned room or moved from an uncleaned room to a clean room without first being steamed or thrown immediately into the dryer on high for 30 mins. Otherwise you will have just reinfested that cleaned room you just spent all that hard work cleaning. Throughout this horrible ordeal, this little Steamfast cannister cleaner outdid itself. Even after all that, I now use it to clean and sanitize everything from our cars interior, the bathroom grout and any matresses/furniture. It restores most things to brand new looking. I haven't had any problems, whatsoever, with it. I love this machine.
